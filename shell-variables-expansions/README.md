SHELL EXPANSIONS
----------------

Each time we type a command line and press the enter key, the shell performs several processes upon the text before it carries out our command. One of these processes is called "expansion", with expansion we type something(qualifying characters) and it is expanded(substituted) into something else before the shell acts upon it.

0 - A bash script that prints hello user, where user is the current linux user.

1 - A bash script that prints all files and folders using wildcards.
