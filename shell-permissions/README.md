The Unix-like operating systems, such as Linux differ from other computing systems in that they are not only multitasking but also multi-user. It means that more than one user can be operating the computer at the same time.

In order to make this practical, a method had to be devised to protect the users from each other. After all, we wouldn't want the actions of one user to crash the computer, nor would we allow one user to interfere with the files belonging to another user.
