SHELL REDIRECTIONS
------------------

In this project, we will explore a powerful feature used by command line programs called input/output redirection. As we have seen, many commands such as 'ls' print their output on the display. This does not have to be the case, however. By using some special notations we can redirect the output of many commands to files, devices, and even to the input of other commands.

0 - A bash script that prints a string (Hello, World) to standard output(screen). 

1 - A bash script that displays file content to screen. 

2 - A bash script that display contents of two files.

3 - A bash script that prints the first 10 lines of a file (/etc/passwd).

4 - A bash script that prints the last 10 lines of a file.

5 - A bash script that prints the 4th line of a file (passwd) using pipelines.

6 - A bash script that creates a newfile with content.
